A blogging site to learn .NET

The backend is written in C#. The available endpoints are:

- `api/users`
- `api/users/{userID}` Optional parameter: `includeposts` (true to include a user's posts int eh response, like so: `?includeposts=true`)
- `api/posts`
- `api/posts{postID}`
- `api/comments`
- `api/comments/{commentID}`

This is in early development, check back later :D
